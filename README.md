![Python Discord - Advent Of Code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-discord/branding/master/logos/logo_seasonal/christmas/2019/banner.png)This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019). For those unfamiliar with the Advent of Code, it is an Advent calendar of programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language. As I'm quite active in [an online Python community](https://pythondiscord.com/), I've picked [Python](https://www.python.org/) to solve the puzzles.
